                <p>I'm Otilia, glad you decided to read about me.<br> Basically, I'm studying computer science at Western University. The story of how I got here is confusing, but I'll give you the short verison. I started off as math student, but decided that wasnt the route for me. Then I found computer science, took some courses, and honestly really grew to love it. <br> Now I'm here!</p>
                <p>I've done a couple projects, but I am most definetily working on more. I have a couple ideas, so just keep refreshing that projects tab!</p>
                <p>Well that's it for now! <br>Thanks for reading, now you can continue going through this really cool website :)</p>
